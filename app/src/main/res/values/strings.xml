    <string name="no_internet_error_message">
        Seems you\'ve tripped into a glitched portal. The Wi-Fi here is weirder than
        a Gazorpazorp\'s sitcom. No signal in this dimension! Fix those cables before you end up
        in a dimension where Meeseeks sends texts in interpretive dance.

    <string name="no_found_error_message">
        Looks like the resource you\'re hunting for got caught in a temporal tug-of-war.
        It\'s off on an adventure through the time vortex. Better equip your time-traveling gear or
        risk ending up in a dimension where smartphones communicate via Morse code.
        Go on, chase that file through the time stream, and try again!

    <string name="service_unavailable_error_message">
        Our service is off exploring dimensions, and all we found was a box labeled \'Adult Papers.\'
        While we reel it back in, imagine the adventures of our digital hamster.
        We\'ll be back faster than an interdimensional paper trail!

    <string name="unknown_error_message">
        The cosmic code hiccuped into an unknown error â€“ think of it as stumbling upon
        a mystery substance in the digital realm. Lab coats are on, goggles are strapped,
        and we\'re decoding this glitchy mix. Stick around; we\'ll fix it faster than
        a quantum bunny on roller skates. Brace yourself for a byte-sized cosmic conundrum solution!
